# Exceedance Probability: The probability of loss from an event exceeding a certain level.
# Usually refers to either the occurrence exceedance probability (OEP) or the aggregate
# exceedance probability, and represent a standard output of cat models. 
# 
# An occurrence probability curve (OEP) is a loss distribution that shows the likelihood
# of exceeding a specified loss threshold  from a single occurrence in any given year.
# The OEP can be calculated from an Event Loss Table (ELT).
# 
# An aggregate exceedance probability curve (AEP) is a loss distribution that shows
# the likelihood of exceeding  a specified loss threshold from one or more events in
# any given year. The AEP can be calculated by convolving the distributions from the
# individual Event Loss Table (ELT) entries (e.g. through Monte Carlo Simulation,
# Panjer or FFT). 
# 
# Secondary uncertainty refers to the distribution of potential loss amounts for a
# given event, while primary uncertainty measures the uncertainty in the likelihood
# of a particular event occurring. EP curves  typically cover primary uncertainty
# but not secondary uncertainty. Inclusion of secondary uncertainty produces smoother
# EP curves with longer tails.
# 
# An annual aggregate loss distribution  is the distribution of the annual aggregate
# losses , covering all relevant uncertainties , in particular secondary uncertainty
